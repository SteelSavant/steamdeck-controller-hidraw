# Steam Deck Controller Hidraw

A small library for reading button inputs from the Steam Deck integrated controller directly from hidraw. 
Currently only supports binary inputs -- direct button presses and whether or not the joysticks or trackpads are being touched.

If it would benefit you to have this library on [crates.io](https://crates.io/), please file an issue.
